                <h2>How We Met</h2>
                <p>Believe it or not, we met at a bar - HA! 
                But seriously, my fiance is a bowler & I happened to bartend at the bar who sponsored his team. 
                As fate would have it, I also worked the same night as bowling league.</p>

                <h2>Our next big step...</h2>
                <p>Our next logical step was to move in together. 
                    After about a year of dating we finally pulled the trigger.
                    We rented a townhouse together in our home town. 
                    We lived here for about a year and a half before our next big move.</p>

                <h2>The House!</h2>
                <p>Our next BIG step was when we decided to buy a home together.
                    At the time my fiance was working insane hours, so his awesome dad came with me to every showing that my fiance couldn't make. 
                    This was super helpful because his dad also has a construction background (lucky me!).
                    After <b>13</b> showings, we finally found the one! 
                    It checked all the boxes - right location, in our price range, the layout we were looking for, etc.
                    Now time for negotiations....

                <p> I will save you all the long, crazy story!
                    Just know that after a long negotiation process we were finally able to close on our house in May 2018!</p>
